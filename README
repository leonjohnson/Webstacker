WebStacker was a OS X Mac application that allowed anyone to graphically layout the structure of a website, using shapes, lines, words and images, and create a functioning website from the design.
WebStacker is fully open-sourced and anyone can use the code for any purpose they deem fit. The application was written in Objective-C (before Swift was released) for OS X around the time of 2012.
